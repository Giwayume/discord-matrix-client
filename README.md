# Discortix - Discord Inspired Matrix Chat Client

This project is a **WORK IN PROGRESS** Matrix chat client, designed for web. Should be mobile app friendly.

Since I have been dissatisfied with the general bugginess and lack of feature parity with Discord found in other Matrix chat clients, I am writing yet another Matrix chat client to do it right.

The design goal is to copy the Discord features as closely as possible within the Matrix spec. This should make an easier transition for Discord users who don't want to learn new things.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue (Official)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Recommended Browser Setup

- Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.):
  - [Vue.js devtools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)
  - [Turn on Custom Object Formatter in Chrome DevTools](http://bit.ly/object-formatters)
- Firefox:

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.
